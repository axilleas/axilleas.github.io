        <p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: I just got a confirmation mail that my proposal got accepted! <a href="http://axilleas.me/en/blog/2013/accepted-for-gsoc-2013">Read here.</a></p>
<p>So, I decided to write some info regarding my involvement for this year's
<a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013" title="Google Summer of Code 2013">Google Summer of Code</a>. I have been using/testing GitLab since
version 2.0 (almost a year now) and I am thrilled to see how much it has
growed since. This year I got a little more involved into this and
I made <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/commits/master/doc/install/installation.md?author=axilleas">two</a> <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/commits/master/lib/tasks/gitlab/check.rake?author=axilleas">commits</a> upstream. Nothing fancy, but I hope to
contribute more as time passes by.</p>
<p>In the rest of this article I will try to explain what GitLab is,
how Fedora is involved into all this and what are the benefits of this involvement.
This is the first of many follow-up posts I intend to write, so keep tight!</p>

<h1 id="what-is-gitlab">What is GitLab?</h1>
<p><a href="http://blog.gitlab.com" title="GitLab home page">GitLab</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq" title="GitLab on Github :p">open source</a> MIT licenced <a href="http://git-scm.com" title="git home page">git</a> repository
management application. It is built on <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a> and is
one of the most <a href="https://github.com/popular/starred" title="GitLab featured in Github's most popular repos">popular</a> projects featured on Github.
It is used by many companies as their internal git management repository.
The reason it gained so much popularity is that it bares a strong resemblance
to github's <a href="http://gitlab.org/screenshots/" title="GitLab screenshots">looks</a> and <a href="http://blog.gitlab.com/features/" title="GitLab features">feels</a>.
It is a project with great potential, under heavy development with a release
cycle every month. That makes it possible to apply bug fixes quite regularly
and test new features. And since a picture is worth a thousand words, here is
a <a href="http://demo.gitlab.com/users/sign_in" title="GitLab demo site">demo site</a> where you can test all the latest features.</p>
<h1 id="fedoras-involvement-so-far">Fedora's involvement so far</h1>
<p>The thought of GitLab being packaged and deployed for <a href="http://fedorahosted.org">Fedora Hosted</a> isn't new.
It all started last March when <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Mojavelinux">Dan Allen</a> <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2012-March/011463.html">proposed</a> GitLab 
to be used as a service for Fedora Hosted. If you follow the conversation 
it summarizes to some key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects pages should be ideally hosted as <code>$projectname.fedorahosted.org</code>.</li>
<li>GitLab and its dependencies should be packaged for Fedora and EPEL 6.</li>
<li>Puppetize the whole thing up. <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/sbadia/gitlab">There</a> are <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/lboynton/gitlab">some</a> configs, but they'll sure need some adjustment.</li>
<li>We need to form a team of maintainers for longterm support even after GSoC is over.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was even a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/gitlabhq/SQMDi-yyXmU">post</a> in GitLab's list, also by Dan Allen,
bringing the project to the attention of the GitLab community.
The most interesting thing was that the <a href="https://github.com/randx">lead developer</a> of GitLab 
was more than willing to help. In the end, there was an <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GSOC_2012/Student_Application_babakb/GitlabSetup" title="Student application for GitLab at GSoC 2012">application</a> but 
unfortunately that was the last anyone heard about the project.</p>
<p>So, here we are a year after with me applying for the project. To be exact
there is <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/summer-coding/2013-March/000286.html">another</a> sudent interested in this as well, so that makes it two of us.
I have already expressed my interest in <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/ruby-sig/2013-March/001270.html">RubySIG</a> and in the <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-March/012631.html">infrastructure</a> mailing list.
I was glad to see that there was a positive response from Dan Allen,
as well as some valuable advice from user <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ktdreyer">Ken Dreyer</a> who currently 
tries to deal with <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Ktdreyer/Gitorious">Gitorious</a>.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-the-benefits">What are the benefits</h1>
<p>There are two major benefits for Fedora.</p>
<h2 id="get-more-ruby-packages-in-the-repos">Get more ruby packages in the repos</h2>
<p>Prior to addressing my interest in the mailing lists, I approached <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Vondruch">VÃ­t Ondruch</a> to get some feedback about this task.
He was very helpful and pointed me to what should be done as a first step.
That is</p>
<ol>
<li>identify which gems are missing in Fedora and package them,</li>
<li>compile a list of gems GitLab is using, including all their dependencies (and possibly bundled dependencies).</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first task, I used a hackish bash script which first accumulates 
all rubygems in a file and then removes the duplicate packages and the ones
that are documentation.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="nv">file_raw</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;/home/axil/tools/fedora-gitlab/rubygems_fedora_raw&#39;</span>
<span class="nv">file_new</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;/home/axil/tools/fedora-gitlab/rubygems_fedora&#39;</span>

yum search all rubygem | awk <span class="s1">&#39;{print $1}&#39;</span> &gt; <span class="nv">$file_raw</span>

sed -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/rubygem-//g&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/.noarch//g&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/.x86_64//g&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
-e <span class="s1">&#39;/i686/d&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;/==/d&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;/:/d&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;/-doc/d&#39;</span> &lt; <span class="nv">$file_raw</span> &gt; <span class="nv">$file_new</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In order to find what gems GitLab depends on, I used the <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/Gemfile.lock">Gemfile.lock</a> 
and wrote a simple python <a href="https://github.com/axilleas/gsoc/blob/master/gemfile.py">script</a><sup id="fnref:python-script"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:python-script" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that computes how many and which gems 
Fedora and GitLab have in common. Below are some draft<sup id="fnref:draft_numbers"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:draft_numbers" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> numbers and a bar chart.</p>
<div id="rubygems_chart"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Gitlab uses: <strong>203</strong> gems.</p>
<p>Fedora has packaged: <strong>385</strong> gems.</p>
<p>There are <strong>97</strong> common gems.</p>
<p>There should be packaged: <strong>106</strong> gems.</p>
<p>Fedora will have <strong>27.53 %</strong> more ruby packages, that is <strong>482</strong> gems in total.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not bad, <strong>106</strong> more ruby packages! That is a plus now that Fedora is considered 
one of <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/wiki/20SupportedPlatforms">Ruby's supported platforms</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I just found out about the <a href="http://isitfedoraruby.com/stats/gemfile_tool">gemfile tool</a> that isitfedoraruby.com<sup id="fnref:isitfedruby"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:isitfedruby" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
is using. This will come in handy. </p>
<h2 id="a-new-service-for-fedorahostedorg">A new service for fedorahosted.org</h2>
<p>After the packaging is done, the next big thing is the deployment process on 
<a href="http://fedorahosted.org">Fedora Hosted</a> as a new service. Quoting Dan Allen's <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-March/012680.html">thought</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the key reasons I've been pushing for GitLab is because I see the
potential it has for drastically improving the discoverability of the
Fedora code base and encourage participation. I've been involved with a lot
of projects on GitHub and I'm amazed by how simple it is to submit changes
(to both code and documentation). In fact, it's often easier to send a
patch with a description of the change than to create an issue...flipping
the normal bug submitting process on its head.</p>
<p>GitHub also works because it enables collaboration over coordination. You
don't have to ask for permission on GitHub. You just do it. Then you can
easily track when they get pulled in or changes are requested. (the same is
true of GitLab).</p>
<p>With GitLab, we can bring that experience to the Fedora community. It's a
large enough community (esp in terms of repositories), that I'm positive
we'd see that collaboration kindle within the Fedora instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, this is a big deal from this point of view :)</p>
<h1 id="next-steps-and-things-to-overcome">Next steps and things to overcome</h1>
<p>There is certainly a lot more to do. For starters, as a Fedora newbie, 
I have to run through the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Ruby">Ruby guidelines</a> and learn 
about the philosophy of rpm. Luckily, I am not a linux newbie (I've been 
using Archlinux for 5 years) and I am adopting rapidly.
Then, I need to learn some Ruby. I have already printed <em><a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide">why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby</a></em>
which is considered a must read, and believe me it is! (download the pdf from <a href="https://github.com/downloads/mislav/poignant-guide/whys-poignant-guide-to-ruby.pdf">here</a>). 
<a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/">Learn Ruby the hard way</a> is also a good starting point. Î think I'm on the right track.</p>
<p>Now, as far as the packaging process is concerned, here is what more needs to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>MariaDB support. Since MariaDB will be the <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2013-January/176584.html" title="Proposed F19 Feature: Replace MySQL with MariaDB">default</a> <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/ReplaceMySQLwithMariaDB" title="Features/ReplaceMySQLwithMariaDB">implementation</a> of MySQL in Fedora 19, GitLab will need to support it.</li>
<li>Write systemd service files. I had made an <a href="https://github.com/axilleas/gitlab-recipes/tree/master/systemd">attempt</a> two months ago when I was trying to set up GitLab on Archlinux, but it is far from perfect.</li>
<li>Packages to be EPEL compatible. A great advantage if GitLab gets packaged for Fedora, is that it would make it as easy as pie to install on a server running Red Hat, Centos, or some other rpm based distro.</li>
<li>Ruby 2.0 compatibility. I don't think that'll be much of a stopper since GitLab is in the <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/commit/52cd655f71c6a5393b71640c13cd95e35e8d2624">process</a> of supporting it, but I put it here just in case.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for now. If you read through here you should have a good understanding
of this project's goal. More posts to come!</p>
