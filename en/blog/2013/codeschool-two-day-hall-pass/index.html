<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a> is an online learning platform that teaches a variety of
programming and web design skills. Courses range from beginner to advanced
levels and you get to earn rewards and badges as you learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Courses cover a variety of technologies including among others <code>Git</code>, <code>Ruby</code>, 
<code>Backbone.js</code>, <code>Sass</code>, <code>Rails</code>, <code>jQuery</code>. Each course has a unique environment 
and some their own theme song, which is kinda cool. Here is the <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/jingles">special page</a> where 
you can find all these songs. </p>
<p>Normally, there is a monthly <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/enroll">subscription</a> that costs only 25$ and 
grants you access to all courses and screencasts, with download links for the 
videos and the presentations.</p>
<p>The current offer covers a 2 day free pass for all courses and screencasts. <a href="http://go.codeschool.com/3UBpUQ">Here</a> 
is my affiliate link<sup id="fnref:afflink"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:afflink" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to get you started (shameless promo :p). 
For each person that signs up, you get two more free days until you reach a 
limit of 30. During this weekend I finished the <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits">Ruby Bits</a> and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real">Git Real</a>
courses and I have to admit I learned a lot. My next goal is the famous <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-redux">Rails for Zombies</a> 
which I am looking forward to complete!</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? <a href="http://go.codeschool.com/3UBpUQ">Go</a> and learn some realy cool stuff!</p>
