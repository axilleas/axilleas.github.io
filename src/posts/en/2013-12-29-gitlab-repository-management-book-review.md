Preface

I remember when I was trying to install GitLab 2.0 with no prior knowledge 
of the rails framework and ruby in general, just copy pasting commands. It seemed fun
and when the login screen showed for the first time, it felt really great!
And then I remember searching for the default username/password. It wasn't documented, rather than
shown somewhere between the commands I was blindly copying. Since then a lot has changed,
the documentation got a lot better, the community has grown big and GitLab took the way it
deserved. This book is a great starting point for newcomers to the GitLab world that have 
little or no prior knowledge of the git workflow that was introduced mainly by Github.
