[TOC]

Hello world! A new Diaspora* pod has come to life. It was initially deployed
for the Greek users, but the registrations are open so anyone can sign up for
a new account and connect to the Diaspora network.

Visit <https://librenet.gr> now!

At this time of writing we host around 300 users. And that has happened in less
in a month!
