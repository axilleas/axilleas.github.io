Title: GitHub Essentials book - an introduction to GitHub
Slug: github-essentials-book-an-introduction-to-github
Tags: book, github, git
Category: books
Lang: en
Status: draft

Last December an e-mail arrived in my inbox. [Packtpub][] contacted me and asked
if I was interested in writing a book. I had made [some]({filename}../2014-01-09-gitlab-repository-management-book-review.md)
[reviews]({filename}../2015-gitlab-cookbook-review.md) for books concerning
GitLab that were published by Packtpub, but I never really thought of writing
one.

And yet here we are, 9 months later my book got published. It is titled
**GitHub Essentials** and you can find it [here][thebook].

I don't know what took me so long to write this post (the book got published on
September 30th), but anyway here it is. I will briefly describe the process I
followed and the tools I used (not very fond of) to get this finished.

## The journey

Like every publisher, Packtpub follows their own process from start to finish.
First you sign a contract agreeing that the copyright belongs to the publisher
as well as a one time payment for the author plus a percentage of the earnings
for each book.

When all this legal stuff gets out of the way, the author has to provide an
outline, that is the chapters and their contents in brief as well as an estimate
of the pages of each chapter. After you finish, you send it for a review and
when agreed that everything is in place, the aquisition editor (that's the guy
that first got in touch with me) crafts a timeline based on the number of pages
each chapter will have. My target was to write about 150 pages and I had to
complete the book in 3 months. Eventually they turned out to be 190 but that
was acceptable.

Not to bore you with details, after finishing each chapter which formed a
first draft, I sent it for a quick review. When the drafts finish this quick
