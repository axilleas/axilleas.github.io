  >[Code School][] is an online learning platform that teaches a variety of
  >programming and web design skills. Courses range from beginner to advanced
  >levels and you get to earn rewards and badges as you learn.

Courses cover a variety of technologies including among others `Git`, `Ruby`, 
`Backbone.js`, `Sass`, `Rails`, `jQuery`. Each course has a unique environment 
and some their own theme song, which is kinda cool. Here is the [special page][jingles] where 
you can find all these songs. 

Normally, there is a monthly [subscription][enrollment] that costs only 25$ and 
grants you access to all courses and screencasts, with download links for the 
videos and the presentations.

The current offer covers a 2 day free pass for all courses and screencasts. [Here][mylink] 
is my affiliate link[^afflink] to get you started (shameless promo :p). 
For each person that signs up, you get two more free days until you reach a 
limit of 30. During this weekend I finished the [Ruby Bits][ruby-bits] and [Git Real][git-real]
courses and I have to admit I learned a lot. My next goal is the famous [Rails for Zombies][zombies] 
which I am looking forward to complete!


So, what are you waiting for? [Go][mylink] and learn some realy cool stuff!


[^afflink]: I got an email from codeschool about this offer and there doesn't seem to be a clear url to reach it. That's why I am posting the affiliate url.
