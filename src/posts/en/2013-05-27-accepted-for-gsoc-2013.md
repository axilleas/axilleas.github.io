Sooo, I am happy to announce that I got accepted to this year's Google Summer of Code!
Couldn't be more happy right now :)

For those that have no idea, here is my [proposal][] on Fedora's wiki ([my user][]). 
I have in mind to make a follow post on how I dealt with all this the past three months.

Special thanks to [John Giannelos][troll] for pressuring me to apply :p
