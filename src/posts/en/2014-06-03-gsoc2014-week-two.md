Here's what I've been doing last week.

# Previous week

## Architecture analysis

Getting to know an app from the ground up takes some time, especially if that's
a framework you are not too familiar with. Luckilly, I found the [railroady][] gem
that helped me visualize how the app is structured, you can find the results 
[here][graphs] (click on one of them and see them as raw).

## Deploy to a testing server

Heroku might be a nice option, but their plans were limiting the database rows.
Instead, I spawned a Fedora 20 droplet in digitalocean and [deployed][] it there.
I used postgres as a database backend, unicorn serving the app and nginx as
a reverse proxy.

First of all, I had to [enable SELinux][enable], I [had][stopdisablingselinux] to,
it was off by default. Then I changed a boolean to make nginx work:

```
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
```

## Started fixing bugs

I keep finding small bugs that I currently keep track in my [trello][] board.
There is currently a [discussion][] to move isitfedoraruby to a more general
namespace, so until then I'm working on my fork and the trello board.

# This week

## Setting up rspec

As this is the primary testing tool, I have started writing the first scenarios
and along the way I'll be adding the actual tests.
