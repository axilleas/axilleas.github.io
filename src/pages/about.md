Hey there! My name is Achilleas Pipinellis and you reached the about me page :)

Here you will find some info about the projects I contribute to, as well as
some personal things, like what my hobbies are.

You can contact me via email or reach to me through the social media. See at
the bottom of this page for contact details.

Find some more info about me in my [CV]({filename}/files/CV_Achilleas_Pipinellis.pdf).

## Contributions to open source

### GitLab
[GitLab][gl-site] is an open source git repository application, built on
Ruby on Rails. I have been using it since version 2.0 and started
contributing in version 4.0.
As of [April 2014][twitter-ann] I am a member of the community [core-team][]
as GitLab recipes lead. I also help at the bug tracker mainly with things
involving documentation, so if you want to ping me, use `@axil`.

### Fedora
In early 2013 I started getting involved with [Fedora][], mainly because
of the [GSoC 2013](|filename|/posts/en/2013-04-07-bringing-gitlab-to-fedora.md) program.
It has a vast community with many developers, sysadmins and users and a lot
of areas you can contribute to.
I currently maintain some [packages][fedora-pkgdb], mostly rubygems.

I had the pleasure to participate in the Google Summer of Code program
in 2013 and 2014 with the Fedora project.

See more info in my [Fedora wiki page][].

### Foss Ntua
We have a local [free and open source community][foss] in my university
where I am a sysadmin. We host several services, among others:

  - a [wiki][] based on MediaWiki
  - a [forum][] based on Discourse
  - a [git server][] based on GitLab
  - a [public server][animal] hosting our members' personal sites
  - a dns server
  - a mail server
  - an xmpp server based on prosody

Apart from the forum we also have a [mailing list][].
Some overview of the uptime status of the services can be found [here][upscuits].

### Archlinux
I've been using [Archlinux][] as my main distribution since 2007.
I maintain several packages at the [AUR][] and I try to contribute to the
[Archwiki][] whenever I can. I am also a member of an unofficial package
team in Greece, where we serve a [repository][archlinuxgr] with popular packages that
aren't in the official repos. I have also contributed to the localization
of pacman and the AUR interface. Check my transifex profile at Contact Details.
Recently I helped to package the [snf-image-creator][snf-arch] tool of
the [synnefo][] IaaS.

## Technical writing

I have always liked writing about technical stuff and my recent involvement
with system administration (2013) has helped a lot.

You can find tutorials I write for DigitalOcean by [visiting my profile][dopro].

### Book author

Yes, as of September 2015 I'm also a book author :)

For the time being my only published book is from Packtpub and is about GitHub:

[GitHub Essentials - Unleash the power of collaborative workï¬‚ow development using GitHub, one step at a time][ghebook]

You can read a sample chapter on [slideshare][ghebook-sl] and read another
chapter in an [article post][ghebook-post] by Packtpub.

## Workstation

I am a proud owner of a Thinkpad x220 running Archlinux.

## Hobbies/Interests

### Aikido
My greatest love is [Aikido][], a japanese martial art. I first started in
January 2010 and have attended a bunch of seminars since. There is a
site of our [dojo][tokaidogr] and some social pages ([facebook][fb-tok],
[twitter][twit-tok], [youtube][yt-tok]). You can check some photos in the
facebook page. My limited skills on graphical design led me to do the artwork of
our dojo as well. Source files can be found on [github][tokaido-artwork].

### Photography
I have an old Olympus DSLR and whenever I have the chance I get pictures.
My main interest is my pets, but I also take landscapes as well. Some day
I hope to buy a more advanced camera which supports custom firmware in
order to hack it :p

**I'll post a link with my photos once I get them sorted**

### Online Courses

Probably not much of a hobby but I do these on my free time, so:

- [Codeschool report card][codeschool]
- [Coursera profile][coursera]

## Favorites

### Movies

I like watching movies and TV series. I always enjoy the Asian cinema and
the Japanese Anime movies and series. Did I mention that I also like manga?

With no particular order (well, except from the first one), some of my
favorite movies are:

  - The Big Lebowski
  - Sin City
  - 12 Angry Men
  - Drive
  - Nine Queens
  - Paprika
  - Weekend at Bernie's
  - Black Dynamite
  - 13 Assassins
  - Hot Fuzz
  - Spirited Away

### Music

I used to play keyboard[^keyboard] in a band, but unfortunately I haven't
practised for a looong time. I also own an electric guitar.

Other than playing, I like listening to music. When working or studying,
most of the times I listen to jazz because I find it non distracting.
Other music genres that I like are funk, blues, classical, and progressive rock/metal.
Often you'll also find me listening to 8bit, dubstep, and electronic :)

If I had to pick one band that I miss not seeing live, that would be Rush.
