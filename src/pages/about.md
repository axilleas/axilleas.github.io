My name is Axilleas Pipinellis and I live in a lovely town near Athens Greece.
I am an undergraduate of [Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences][semfe] at
[Ntua][ntua], currently studying math(statistics) and CS.

[TOC]

## Open source matters

### Foss Ntua
We have a local [free and open source community][foss] in my university
where I am a sysadmin. We host several services such as a [wiki][], a [forum][],
a couple of [mailing lists][], a [statusnet][] instance and a [public server][animal]
hosting our members' personal sites. Mine is [here][animal-axil]. From time
to time we run seminars and workshops where everyone is free to attend.

### Archlinux
I've been using [Archlinux][] as my main distribution since 2007.
I maintain several packages at the [AUR][] and I try to contribute to the
[Archwiki][] whenever I can. I am also a member of an unofficial package
team in Greece, where we serve a [repository][archlinuxgr] with popular packages that
aren't in the official repos. I have also contributed to the localization
of pacman and the AUR interface. Check my transifex profile at Contact Details.
Recently I helped to package the [snf-image-creator][snf-arch] tool of 
the [synnefo][] IaaS.

### Fedora
Recently I started getting involved with [Fedora][], mainly because
of the [GSoC 2013][] program. It has a vast community with many developers
and users who are always willing to help and that's the beauty with it :)
I'll probably fill in more info once I get more involved (which is something 
I intend to do).

### GitLab
[GitLab][gl-site] is an open source git repository application, built on Ruby on Rails.
I have been using it since version 2.0 and started contributing as of version 4.0.
In [this](|filename|/pages/gitlab-accepted-patches.md) page you will find all my 
patches that were accepted by upstream. A relative article can be found [
here](|filename|/posts/en/2013-04-07-bringing-gitlab-to-fedora.md).


## Hobbies/Interests

### Aikido
My greatest love is [Aikido][], a japanese martial art. I first started in 
January 2010 and have attended a bunch of seminars since. I maintain the 
site of our [dojo][tokaidogr] and our social pages ([facebook][fb-tok], [twitter][twit-tok], 
[youtube][yt-tok], [gplus][g+tok]). You can check some photos [here][tokaido-photos-db].
My limited skills on graphical design led me to do the artwork of our dojo
as well. Source files can be found on [github][tokaido-artwork].

### Photography
I have an old Olympus DSLR and whenever I have the chance I get pictures.
My main interest is my pets, but I also take landscapes as well. Some day 
I hope to buy a more advanced camera which supports custom firmware in 
order to hack it :p

**I'll post a link with my photos once I get them sorted**

## Favorites

### Food
I looooove food. I also love to cook :) My favorite chef is Jamie Oliver
and I have almost all of his shows and have atempted to cook a bunch of his 
foods. I once tried to make a 30 minute meal. It took me 3 hours... but
it was sure worth the effort.

I'll post some of my favorite recipes in due time.

### Movies

  - The big Lebowski: This is where my blog's name is taken :)

**More to come...**

### Music

**TODO**
